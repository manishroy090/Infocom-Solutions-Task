# Laravel + Next.js Full Stack Project

This project is a **full-stack application** built using **Laravel (Backend API)** and **Next.js (Frontend)**.
The primary focus of this task was **backend architecture, authentication, performance, and clean code practices**.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Laravel
* **Frontend:** Next.js
* **Authentication:** JWT (stored in HTTP-only cookies)
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Architecture:** Repository Pattern
* **Validation:** Form Request Classes
* **Authorization:** Custom Roles & Permissions (no third-party packages)
* **Excel Import:** Chunk reading + Queue processing

```

---

## 🚀 Project Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd project-root
```

---

## ⚙️ Backend Setup (Laravel)

```bash
cd backend
composer install
```

### Configure Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Update the database credentials inside `.env`.

---

### Run Migrations & Seeders

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

> 🔐 **Login credentials** are available inside:
> `database/seeders/UserSeeder.php`

---

### Queue Configuration (Required)

This project uses **Laravel Queues** for background processing (Excel import).

Make sure your queue connection is configured in `.env`:

```env
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

Run queue migrations if not already done:

```bash
php artisan queue:table
php artisan migrate
```

Start the queue worker **before performing Excel import**:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

---

### Serve the Backend

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Backend will run at:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

---

## 🌐 Frontend Setup (Next.js)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend will run at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

* JWT-based authentication
* Token is generated by Laravel and stored in **HTTP-only cookies**
* **JWT is handled only on the backend**
* Frontend does not store or manage tokens
* Cookies are automatically sent with API requests
* Improves security against XSS attacks

---

## 👥 Roles & Permissions

* Custom **Roles & Permissions** implementation
* No external packages used
* Fully controlled authorization logic
* Middleware-based access control

---

## 📊 Excel Import (Chunk + Queue)

* Excel import implemented using **chunk reading**
* Data is processed using **Laravel queues**
* Prevents memory issues on large files
* Improves performance and scalability

⚠ **Important:**
Before importing Excel files, ensure the queue worker is running:

```bash
php artisan queue:work
```

---

## 🧱 Backend Architecture

### Repository Pattern

* Controllers remain thin
* Business logic handled in repositories
* Easy to maintain, test, and extend

### Validation

* Laravel **Form Request classes** used
* Clean separation of validation logic
* Consistent and reusable validation rules

---

## 🎯 Notes

* This task was completed with a **strong backend focus**
* Priority was given to:

  * Code structure
  * Security
  * Performance
  * Scalability
  * Best practices

Frontend implementation is minimal and primarily serves as a consumer of the backend APIs.

---

## ✅ Summary

✔ JWT Authentication using cookies
✔ Custom role & permission system (no packages)
✔ Repository pattern implementation
✔ Request validation using Form Requests
✔ Excel import with chunk & queue processing
✔ Clean and scalable backend architecture

If you want next, I can:

* Rewrite this as a **technical assignment submission**
* Add **API endpoint documentation**
* Add **architecture diagram explanation**
* Make it **more concise for HR / CEO review**

Just tell me 👌
